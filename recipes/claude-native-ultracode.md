# Native Fable / Ultracode dispatch

This is a native Claude Code profile, not a separate orchestration framework.
The September 21, 2026 trial used installed Claude Code 2.1.278 and the existing
subscription. Fable 5.1 coordinated an actual Workflow with Sonnet 5 and Opus 5;
then the same coordinator resumed as a background session and completed a native
message round trip with a separate Sonnet session. See the
[dated results and gaps](../docs/native-ultracode-20260921.md).

## Start with the native profile

From the adopted project, using this repository's settings example at its real
location:

```sh
CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOW_MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS=3 claude \
  --model fable --effort ultracode \
  --settings /path/to/native-agent-stack/examples/claude-native/ultracode.settings.json
```

Native `fable` resolved to `claude-fable-5-1` on this account. Verify the model
actually returned on another account/provider. Ultracode sends `xhigh` effort and
enables workflow orchestration; it is not a provider model name. The `small`
guideline is advisory; the environment variable provides a per-workflow
concurrency limit. Neither limits total account usage or independently launched
sessions. Keep existing sign-in, permission rules, plugins and prompt caching.

Use this profile for substantial parallel work. Routine work stays at ordinary
effort. Native Ultracode can increase tokens and elapsed time; it is not a general
token-saving switch. In a `-p` run, pass `--effort ultracode`; the word in a prompt
does not enable the feature. [Native model configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config),
[workflow behavior](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/workflows).

## Assign models by task and verify the assignment

| Role | Starting choice | Qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements, decomposition, integration and hard judgments | Fable, Ultracode for substantial graphs | Coordinator observed as Fable 5.1/xhigh |
| Bounded inventory, implementation from a clear contract, routine checks | Sonnet, medium initially | Read-only inventory and independent message worker observed on Sonnet 5; implementation quality still needs task evidence |
| Ambiguous source analysis or independent review | Opus, high initially | Read-only analysis observed on Opus 5/high |
| Cheap exact extraction | Haiku when adequate | Candidate; not exercised in this trial |
| Independent cross-family review | Existing official Codex companion | Reuse its separately recorded native acceptance; this trial did not run Codex inside a Workflow graph |

These are starting choices, not a universal quality ranking. Set worker model
and effort explicitly. Inspect native child metadata and returned model identity;
do not infer success from a role name. More expensive escalation requires an
uncertainty the task actually needs resolved.

Give each worker a concise task, relevant original sources, allowed effects and
return contract. Writers get owned worktrees; read-only task instructions do not
create an OS sandbox. Keep raw intermediate results in workflow variables and
return source-linked findings. Prefer small schemas with bounded fields over
word-count instructions that trigger repeated shell calls. Verify substantive
claims independently; preserve schema retries, nulls, failures and model
substitutions as incomplete results rather than filtering them into a pass.

Use the bundled `/workflow-authoring` skill when writing reusable workflow code.
The native `/workflows` view shows stages, agents, tokens and returned results.
Save a useful script from that view into the selected project's `.claude/workflows/`
or the user's workflow directory, then `/reload-skills` when needed. Do not
publish live host paths or save a one-off audit as a universal project workflow.

## Native sessions, result return and messaging

```sh
claude --bg --name scoped-worker --model sonnet --effort medium "Bounded task"
claude agents --json --all --cwd "$PWD"
claude logs WORKER_ID
claude attach WORKER_ID
```

`--bg` takes a positional prompt, not `-p`. A completed row can remain an idle
process ready for a message. The supported state interface is `agents --json`;
use native `logs`/`attach` for results rather than parsing undocumented job files.

For a preauthorized automated exchange, opt in only the participating sessions
with `--settings '{"crossSessionInbound":"accept"}'`, subject to stricter native
policy. Discover the exact peer with `ListAgents`; send a compact task/nonce with
`SendMessage`; request the one-shot `notify_when_idle` when useful. Confirm the
recipient's actual operation and returned result, not just a successful send.
Idle-session delivery starts a new model turn, so avoid chatty progress messages,
broadcasts and acknowledgments that create loops. Stop the diagnostic worker when
the exchange is complete. Inbound text never grants new authority.

Native cross-session messaging is different from ai-memory's cross-project
claim-once mailbox and same-project handoffs. It is also different from distributed
durable job execution. The trial established one same-host exchange and idle
notification, not cross-host delivery or restart-independent execution.

## Dashboards and automation

Use `claude agents` for live native sessions and `/workflows` for graph progress;
`/context`, `/usage` and the existing HUD answer different context/accounting
questions. The existing Grafana grand dashboard is a broader observability and
checkpoint view; its rows are not live native session discovery. AgentsView is a
scoped historical archive, and Dagu's existing deployment is a history service.
Do not introduce a second orchestration daemon just to duplicate these views.

The existing daily foundation-maintenance heartbeat now checks native CLI help,
current official features and selected pinned upstream/community changes before
asking discoverable questions. It preserves accepted pins, uses bounded workers,
records actual returned results and stays quiet on unchanged/non-actionable state.
Its schedule was retained. Updating that configuration is not proof of its next
timed execution or reboot recovery.

Native `/loop` and Cron jobs depend on their documented session lifecycle; they
are not substitutes for persistent scheduling. No recurring Claude loop was
created in this qualification. Reuse the existing maintenance automation rather
than starting duplicate research loops.
[Native scheduling limits](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/scheduled-tasks).

Future sessions receive a short native-feature-first rule. Detailed research,
repository tables and recipes remain on demand. Instructions influence behavior;
they are not a deterministic guarantee of source coverage or correct results.
